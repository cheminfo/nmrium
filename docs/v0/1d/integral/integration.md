#### Automatic integration

You mark a signal by simultaneously holding down the shift key and the left mouse button and moving the mouse over the range of the signal. After releasing both keys, the integral of the signal appears. On the right side of the screen, under the "Integrals" tab, a list of all integrals is listed. If you move the mouse over the shift of the integral in the spectrum, the corresponding entry is displayed in the list. If you move the mouse over a certain line in the list, the corresponding integral in the spectrum is marked.

#### Delete all integrals

To delete all integrals move the mouse to the list "Integrals" and press the trash button on the left side above the list. A red box apears. Click "yes". All integrals are deleted.

#### Delete a single integral

To delete one integral move the mouse to the list and select a integral. Press the trash button on the rigth side of the line of the signal. The integral is deleted.

An alternativ way to delete a single integral is to move the mouse over a integral in the spectrum. A red ring appears. Click this red ring, the integral is deleted.

#### Change integral sum

The default sum of all integrated protons is 100. To change this sum, click on the sum symbol. A grey box appears. Enter the total number of integrated protons and click "Set".  In the list on the right side, the relative number of protons for the respective integral is indicated.
